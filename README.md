#  Marketing Campaign Performance Analysis — Power BI Dashboard

##  Project Brief
This project analyzes marketing campaign performance across multiple digital platforms and campaign types. The goal is to understand how ad spend converts into revenue, identify high-performing platforms and campaigns, and recommend optimization strategies to improve ROAS(Return on Ad Spent/Invesment) and profitability.

The dashboard was built in **Power BI**, using KPI cards, column charts, combo charts, line charts, tables, and slicers to provide a clear, interactive view of performance across platforms, campaigns, countries, and industries.

##  Business Objectives
- Identify which **ad platforms**(Google Ads, Meta Ads, TikTok Ads) deliver the highest revenue and best return on investment (ROAS).
- Compare **campaign types** (Search, Display, Video, Shopping) for performance efficiency  
- Understand **monthly trends** in spend and revenue  
- Analyze performance across **countries and industries**  
- Recommend where to **increase or decrease budget allocation**  based on outcomes.
